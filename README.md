Building a simple modern 2D engine for simulation projects like simulating ants and possibly other agent based systems (that's where the name is from) and small games. 

**Does** support:

* Super simple 2D rendering (WIP)
* Entity-Component-System (ECS)
* Entity Hierarchy (almost a Scene Graph), parent-child relationships between Entities
* Tests for the major modules
* Mouse events at component-level

**Planned**: Take a look at the [project(s)](https://github.com/lionkor/antsim3/projects)

Requirements

* `fmt`, included
* `doctest`, included
* `sfml`, currently not included, which will change (probably)

All it will be is a simple lightweight hobby project engine.
