A 2D cross-platform game engine written in C++20. Supports scripting with Lua and C-linkage DLLs.

You'll need a C++ 20 capable compiler.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/lionkor/Volty/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to contribute.

## Scripting

### Lua

Lua documentation coming soon.

### C Documentation

Volty supports loading C-linkage dynamic libraries. This means that you can write in *any*
language that supports exporting symbols as C linkage, such as C++/Rust (`extern "C"`) or,
of course, C.

Documentation for this interface coming soon.
