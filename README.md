Building a simple modern 2D engine for simulation projects like simulating ants and possibly other agent based systems (that's where the name is from) and small games. 

**Will** support: 

* 2D rendering
* Hit detection, collision
* Simple physics
* Loading & saving state
* Simple GUI

Requirements

* `fmt`, included as a submodule
* `sfml`, currently not included, which will change (probably)

All it will be is a simple lightweight hobby project engine.
